        <h1>List of Pokémon</h1>
      </div>
      The Pokémon franchise revolves around 898 fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs
      and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon
      World. The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, plants,
      mythological creatures and even inanimate objects. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful
      species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. There are even some of them that
      cannot evolve. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team
      of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and
      determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous
      creatures.
      The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into "Generations", with each division primarily encompassing new
      titles in the main video game series and often a change of handheld platform. Generation I refers to Red, Green,
      Blue, and Yellow; Generation II refers to Gold, Silver, and Crystal; Generation III refers to Ruby, Sapphire,
      FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald; Generation IV refers to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver;
      Generation V refers to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2; Generation VI refers to X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha
      Sapphire; Generation VII refers to Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon, Let's Go, Pikachu!, and Let's Go, Eevee!; and
      Generation VIII refers to Sword and Shield. Each Generation is also marked by the addition of new Pokémon: 151 in
      Generation I in the Kanto region, 100 in Generation II in the Johto region, 135 in Generation III in the Hoenn
      region, 107 in Generation IV in the Sinnoh region, 156 in Generation V in the Unova region, 72 in Generation VI in
      the Kalos region, 88 in Generation VII in the Alola and Kanto regions, and 89 in Generation VIII in the Galar
      region.
      Due to the large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. The 896
      Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides
      various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving
      around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example,
      the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original
      151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species
      obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a
      notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex and is also uniquely numbered as number
      000.

        <h1>Concept</h1>
      </div>
      The premise of Pokémon in general was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri—who later founded Game Freak—in 1989, when the
      Game Boy was released. The creatures that inhabit the world of Pokémon are also called Pokémon.[1] The word
      "Pokémon" is a romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā).[2] The
      concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems most
      notably from Tajiri's childhood hobby of insect collecting. Other influences on the concept include Ultraman,
      anime, and playing video games in general. Throughout his early life, Tajiri saw his rural, nature-filled hometown
      (Machida, Tokyo) transform into an urban center. The urbanization of his town drove away wildlife and he and
      others living in the area were eventually unable to collect insects. Through Pokémon, Tajiri sought to bring back
      this outdoor pastime and share it with the world.[1] The first games in the franchise, Red and Green, were
      released on 27 February 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy;[3] the games saw an international release as Red and Blue
      in September 1998.[4] The ability to capture, battle, trade, and care for numerous creatures catapulted Pokémon to
      international popularity[2] and it has become a multibillion-dollar franchise and the second-best selling video
      game series, only behind the Mario franchise.[5]
      At the start of a main series Pokémon game, the player character receives one of three "starter" Pokémon, with
      which they can battle and catch other Pokémon. Each Pokémon has one or two "types", such as Fire, Water, or Grass.
      In battle, certain types are strong against other types. For example, a fire-type attack will do more damage to a
      grass-type Pokémon than a water-type attack.[6] This form of gameplay is frequently compared to that of
      rock-paper-scissors, though players have to strategize which Pokémon and which of their attacks to use against
      various opponents.[7][8]
      Many species of Pokémon are capable of evolving into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is
      accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to a wider variety of attacks. There are
      multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a
      specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the
      Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire),
      Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In
      Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal
      Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for
      the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are
      capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some
      species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes
      and type alterations but are not considered new species. Some Pokémon have differences in appearance due to
      gender. Pokémon can be male or female, male-only, female-only, or genderless.[9]
      Though the Pokémon franchise is primarily intended for younger players, each Pokémon has various complex
      attributes such as natures, characteristic traits, Individual Values (IVs), and Effort Values (EVs). These,
      according to Game Freak Board Director Junichi Masuda, are intended for people "who enjoy battling and want to go
      more in depth". These individual statistics were also included because the basic concept of the franchise is to
      train one's Pokémon. Designer Takeshi Kawachimaru stated that IVs and EVs "help to make each Pokemon in the game
      individual", as it adds unique aspects to them.[10] Each Pokémon game introduces a few "Legendary" and "Mythical"
      Pokémon that are powerful, rare, and hard to catch.[11] Pokémon Sun and Moon introduced "Ultra Beasts", which are
      described as "beings from another dimension" that appeared in the Alola region and are similarly powerful and
      rare.[12]

        <h1>Design and development</h1>
      </div>
      Throughout development of Red and Green, all Pokémon were designed by Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri,
      and a team of fewer than ten people,[14] including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of
      Pikachu.[15][16] By 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five
      people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the
      look of each creature.[14][17] Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of
      the official artwork for the games.[14][18] According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five
      to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game.[17] In rare cases, rejected designs are brought
      back and released in a later generation.[19] Shigeru Ohmori, director of Sun and Moon, admitted that creating new
      Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year
      history.[20] Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.[21]
      The designs for Pokémon are often highly analogous to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate
      objects.[21] Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno have stated that inspiration for Pokémon
      designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world provide the basis for
      countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise.[22] The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into
      account when they are designed.[23] The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of
      Sun and Moon.[20] Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason.[23] In some cases, the
      design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that.[24] Some designers
      look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting.[20]
      Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and
      other times they are designed around a particular type.[25] Each Pokémon has a specific height and weight.[26]
      The simpler roots of designs in Generation I prompted greater complexity in later games.[21] Designs, in general,
      have become increasingly complex and thematic in newer games.[18] Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the
      Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are
      all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics.[27] New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are
      heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France).[18] However, by the release of X and Y in
      2013, Sugimori stated he wishes for Pokémon design to return to the simpler roots of the franchise.[28]
      Masuda considers the starter Pokémon to be among the most important in the franchise; Yoshida goes further and
      calls them "the face of that generation" and says that "they're the ones that should be on the packaging".[17] The
      three starter Pokémon of each generation are always Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers
      to be the easiest to understand for new players.[25] Their designs are based on recognizable animals and made to
      stand out from pre-existing Pokémon. Furthermore, each are given distinct personalities to further define
      them.[29] In an interview with GamesRadar in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to
      design and develop, whereas Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may
      take over a year. Masuda added, "We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible, we don't want to
      narrow down their imagination by saying 'We want this kind of Pokemon.' When we talk to the designer we always
      stress that they shouldn't think of Pokemon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can."
      After the Pokémon is designed it is sent to the "Battle Producer", who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon
      should have.[10]
